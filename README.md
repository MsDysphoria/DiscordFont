## Information
`What it is` <br />
- It's an open source third party plugin written for BetterDiscord. At first it was going to be for my personal use, but then I decided to share. It's essentially a character converter one could find on the internet by searching for 'Discord Font Generator', the only difference is that the conversion happens as the user sends messages without any extra steps to make things quicker.
 
`𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝘁 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸𝘀` <br />
- DiscordFont allows different fonts, numbers, special characters and space width to be used in chat. It does it through replacing the letters, numbers and spaces of the message that is about to be sent with the special characters defined inside the arrays in the code. Upon sending a message, each character in it is replaced with the font, number style and space width chosen and the result can be seen after the message is sent. It also allows users to define custom rules for special characters.
